# Daily-Wu-Dao
每日悟道，程序世界，缤纷烦劳，亦智亦劳，我非金身，常须修养，旦日无扰，自然创造

Everyday is one day, the job we can complete is limited, so we need to reject something that we can't finish it before the deadline.At the same time, we need to understand what Dao means, which is an ideology born in China in 2000 BC at least.
